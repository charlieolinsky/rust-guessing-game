# rust-guessing-game

I am currently learning rust. I am following the documentation which can be found here:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html

My guessing game is a CLI program that generates a random number and has the user continously guess
until they are correct or "win." The user will be informed if their guess was "too big" or "too small" until 
they eventually guess correctly.
